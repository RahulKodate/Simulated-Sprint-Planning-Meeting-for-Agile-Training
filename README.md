- **Duration**: The presentation must be between 8 and 10 minutes.
- **Submission**: No late submissions are accepted.

## Background
Susan Edwards, the VP of Operations, has requested assistance with conducting a Sprint Planning meeting for a new scrum team, "Scrum Newbie." Our task was to facilitate a simulated Sprint Planning meeting, including backlog prioritization, story point assignment, and recommendations for the next sprint.

## Instructions
1. **Assign Story Points (2 minutes)**: Assign story points to new features based on complexity.
2. **Prioritization (2 minutes)**: Use MoSCoW technique to prioritize backlog features.
3. **Velocity Discussion (30-40 seconds)**: Discuss current velocity and forecast for the next sprint.
4. **Next Sprint (2 minutes)**: Select features for the next sprint based on velocity and priorities.
5. **Information Radiators (2 minutes)**: Demonstrate a Kanban board as an information radiator.

## Team Roles
- **Susan Edwards (Product Owner)**: Adwaith Korapati
- **Scrum Master (Team Newbie)**: Lakshmi Shreya Malapaka
- **Scrum Master (Current Team)**: Sakshi Shetty
- **Developer 1**: Rahul Ashok Kodate
- **Developer 2**: Ram Chitrala

## Minutes of the Meeting

### Start of Meeting
**Adwaith (Product Owner)**: Introduced the agenda and asked Shreya for the current status of Scrum Newbie's sprint.

**Shreya (Newbie Team Scrum Master)**: Provided an update on the current sprint status.

**Sakshi (Current Team Scrum Master)**: Inquired about the new features for story point assignment.

**Rahul (Developer 1)** and **Ram (Developer 2)**: Assigned story points to the new features based on complexity and discussed disagreements.

### Prioritization
**Adwaith (Product Owner)**: Demonstrated MoSCoW prioritization technique on the whiteboard.

**Shreya (Newbie Team Scrum Master)** and **Team**: Prioritized features using MoSCoW technique and conducted fist-of-five voting.

### Velocity Discussion
**Sakshi (Current Team Scrum Master)**: Discussed Scrum Newbie's average velocity and suggested features for the next sprint based on the velocity.

**Adwaith (Product Owner)**: Facilitated discussion on features to include in the next sprint and resolved issues related to feature selection.

### Information Radiators
**Sakshi (Current Team Scrum Master)**: Demonstrated the Kanban board technique and discussed its benefits for visibility and transparency.

**Shreya (Newbie Team Scrum Master)**: Provided feedback on the demonstration and expressed appreciation.

## Solution
The meeting successfully demonstrated agile principles and techniques. Key outcomes included:
- Prioritization of features using MoSCoW.
- Story points assignment and velocity-based feature selection.
- Implementation of a Kanban board for better visibility and progress tracking.

## Conclusion
The project provided valuable insights into conducting effective Sprint Planning meetings and applying agile methodologies in a practical setting. The team effectively demonstrated backlog management, prioritization, and the use of information radiators.
